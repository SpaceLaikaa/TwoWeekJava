🪶 TwoWeekJava

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects created over 14 days.  
Each day, I build a new project to improve my programming logic, problem-solving skills, and Java fundamentals.

🎯 Goal
To write one Java project every day for two weeks, covering topics like:
- Variables and Data Types  
- Loops and Conditionals  
- Functions and Classes  
- OOP Concepts  
- File Handling and Exceptions  
- Simple real-world applications
- Arrays (working with collections of data)
